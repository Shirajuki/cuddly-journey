It's not that I want to live happily ever after...

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,620
Nor am I looking to be promised something definite.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,080
But more than that...

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,880
Some place beyond, there should be...

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,360
- ...the place where I want to be.
- ...the place where I want to be.

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,880
You don't have to go all the way to a university in Tokyo...

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
We don't have cram schools here to help you prep...

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,160
Gotta go to cram school, later man.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,020
Isn't he testing for uni this year?
I wonder when he studies...?

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,320
- Interesting.
-Is something the matter?

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,880
No, it's just that these two are so alike...
Same simple mistakes, same thinking behind their proofs.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,640
(Well done!)

Don't get too down on yourself even if you don't get in.

16
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,320
...Well here I go!

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,020
Heading out, bye.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,860
Oh, it's today, isn't it? I wonder how it went for those kids...

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm not alone anymore.
