1
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,330
Machiko!

2
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,370
Honey!

3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,790
Where are we?

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,830
I dont know.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,370
I dont remember a thing.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,170
You too?

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,830
You mean you dont either?

8
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,240
Please, come in.

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,700
Welcome to Quindecim.

10
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,490
Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am Decim, your bartender.

11
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,330
Hello.

12
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,620
Now, then. If you will indulge me,

13
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,710
I must ask you a question.

14
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,290
Do you remember anything that happened just before your arrival?

15
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,300
No, nothing.

16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,260
Although...

17
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,970
I think we were on our honeymoon.

18
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,930
Youre right! I remember that much, at least.

19
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,310
Very good.

20
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,930
Thank you very much.

21
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,940
So tell us... What is this place?

22
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Allow me to explain your circumstances.

23
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,820
I ask that you pay close attention.

24
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,110
First:

25
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,330
I cannot tell you where you are.

26
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,950
Second:

27
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,330
The two of you are here to play a game.

28
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,580
A game?

29
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,380
Third:

30
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,840
The game you play will be chosen via roulette.

31
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Fourth:

32
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,140
Your lives will be staked on this game.

33
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,930
W-Wait a minute!

34
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,890
Fifth:

35
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,640
Until the game is over,

36
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,100
you cannot leave this bar.

37
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,140
What?

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,900
Lets go, Machiko. This guys not worth our time.

39
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,900
O-Okay.

40
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,360
Poor bastards off his rocker.

41
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,030
Huh?

42
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,030
Just a bathroom.

43
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,660
Damn it.

44
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,880
How do we get out of here?

45
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,800
You cannot leave the bar until the game is over.

46
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,050
And if we refuse to play your game?

47
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,020
I would not recommend that.

48
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,770
Wh-Whats going on?

49
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,730
Honey, are those...

50
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,240
What the hell?

51
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,820
Are those actually bodies?

52
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,120
This is all I can tell you:

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,080
You are here to play a game on which your lives depend.

54
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,290
Whats this guy up to?

55
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,090
If you would go ahead and press this button, the roulette will commence...

56
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,380
and the game will be chosen.

57
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,880
Honey...

58
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,090
Lets just go along with it for now.

59
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,430
Theres no telling what he might do if we dispute him.

60
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,100
Good thinking.

61
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,920
The rules are simple.

62
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,260
You will take turns throwing each of the darts in front of you until one of you reaches a score of zero.

63
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,470
In the event that you run out of darts before that happens,

64
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,270
the one with the lowest score will be declared the winner.

65
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,350
You each have seven darts.

66
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,190
Please be mindful of the throw line at your feet.

67
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,520
The outer ring nets you double points,

68
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,110
and the inner ring nets you triple.

69
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,530
A single-bull is worth 25 points,

70
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,200
and a double-bull is worth 50.

71
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,950
There are regions of the body inscribed on the targets,

72
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,420
each of which is linked to a set of your nerves.

73
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,590
What was that?

74
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,670
Theyre "linked" to us?

75
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,420
Yes. If pierced by a dart, you will feel pain.

76
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,680
Well what?!

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,800
The higher the score, the greater the pain will be.

78
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,680
Y-You cant be serious.

79
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
I...

80
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,100
Calm down.

81
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
You know that cant be true.

82
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,060
Lets just keep playing along for now.

83
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,980
But...

84
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,070
If worst comes to worst,

85
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,860
Ill find us a way out of this.

86
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,990
Honey...

87
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,530
Well, then.

88
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,120
Let us begin the game.

89
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,010
"Linked", my ass.

90
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,970
Even the idea is ridiculous.

91
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,890
Machiko!

92
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,890
Youre kidding me!

93
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,890
It couldve been my imagination.

94
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,310
It was just a little twinge.

95
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,610
It doesnt hurt anymore.

96
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,400
Thank you. Im fine.

97
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,280
But...

98
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,900
Calm down, dear.

99
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,200
Let me give it a try.

100
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,170
Honey!

101
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,550
Did it actually hurt you?!

102
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,300
That settles it.

103
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,180
How the hell are they doing this?

104
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,810
Did something stab me?!

105
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,940
No, theres nothing.

106
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Honey!

107
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,520
Just wait there!

108
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,770
You cant fool me that easy!

109
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,150
Im a doctor!

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,320
There arent any signs of surgery.

111
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,240
What did you do to us?!

112
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,610
Nothing in particular.

113
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,370
Then what is this pain?!

114
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,160
I was very clear.

115
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,160
In this game, your lives are on the line.

116
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,220
If you wish to avoid the pain, you do not have to hit the target.

117
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,880
What?

118
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,180
If you miss with the rest of your darts, the game will come to an end.

119
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,310
Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,850
We could always do that instead.

121
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,310
In that case, Machiko would be declared the winner.

122
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,320
Id lose?

123
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,910
Whats going on, honey?

124
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,740
Takashi?

125
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,450
Oh...

126
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,160
It sounds like we have to keep playing the game.

127
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,750
But he just gave me quite the tip.

128
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,670
All we have to do is miss.

129
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,380
Itll be over before we know it.

130
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,380
We can do that?

131
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,170
Yeah.

132
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,970
But if we do, then youll lose.

133
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,390
Dont let that get to you.

134
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,270
Its fine.

135
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,140
It doesnt matter who wins or loses.

136
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,310
I still have Machiko.

137
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,030
Whats the matter?

138
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,780
Its your turn.

139
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,950
Oh, right.

140
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,910
Sorry.

141
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,220
Shit!

142
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,680
Im sorry, Machiko!

143
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,230
My hand slipped!

144
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,390
I-Its all right, honey.

145
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,560
Thanks.

146
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,500
My eyes!

147
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,920
Im sorry, dear!

148
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,090
Are you okay?

149
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,920
You just had to hit the double!

150
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,430
I didnt do it on purpose! Honest!

151
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,770
Im sorry, honey. Im so sorry!

152
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,940
Forgive me.

153
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,440
Please dont!

154
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,950
Please, at least...

155
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,030
not in the stomach.

156
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,450
Not at your child.

157
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,390
What? Are you serious?

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Yes.

159
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,590
Now that I think about it,

160
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,800
you have been out of sorts lately.

161
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,590
Yeah.

162
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,510
How many weeks?

163
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,100
Ten.

164
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,220
Why didnt you say anything?

165
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,600
I wanted to surprise you on our honeymoon.

166
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,400
I still havent told anyone.

167
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,110
I wanted you to be the first to know.

168
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,360
Really?

169
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,610
Thank you, Machiko.

170
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,660
Try not to overexert yourself.

171
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,370
Okay.

172
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,910
Im sorry.

173
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,370
So Im finally going to be a father.

174
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,780
How could you...

175
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,150
I didnt do it on purpose.

176
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,410
Liar! What if something happened to the baby?!

177
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,120
Wh-What?

178
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,620
I cant believe I let something so important get away from me.

179
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,130
What are you talking about?

180
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,500
Dont give me that.

181
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,800
That was such a lovely ceremony.

182
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,760
Yeah. Macchi sure does play to win, doesnt she?

183
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,510
Youre telling me.

184
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,510
Macchi? Do they mean Machiko?

185
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,510
Come to think of it,

186
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,100
shes always been a smooth operator, hasnt she?

187
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,020
I hear her husbands another doctor.

188
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,520
And shes got a stud on the side. Im so freaking jealous!

189
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,780
I heard every word they said.

190
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,030
Your friends really have no class.

191
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,540
Whats that supposed to mean?

192
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,540
Imagine finding out on your wedding day that your wife is having an affair.

193
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
I dont know what youre talking about!

194
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,130
Still, I couldnt bring myself to stop the ceremony.

195
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,640
I just kept trying to block out what theyd said.

196
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,970
Im telling you, youve got it all wrong!

197
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,560
I was so in love with you!

198
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,810
And I love you, too! You dont know what youre saying!

199
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,140
Dont lie to me!

200
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,310
Im not lying! Its the truth!

201
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,570
You and I are through.

202
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,660
Tell me something.

203
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,780
What is it?

204
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,040
Theres more to the game than those rules, isnt there?

205
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,290
That ones not yours.

206
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,960
That may be,

207
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,670
but the rules didnt say anything about who can throw each dart.

208
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,540
Am I wrong?

209
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,170
You are correct.

210
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,210
As long as a dart hits a target, points are scored.

211
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,760
They planned on us taking from each other from the start.

212
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,010
Seven darts were never enough.

213
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,310
You are down to one final dart,

214
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,930
so the next person to score will be the winner.

215
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,560
What happens to the loser?

216
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,070
I am terribly sorry, but I cannot answer that.

217
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,650
You heard the man.

218
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,740
I think its about time I showed Ms. Play-to-Win the taste of defeat. How about it, Macchi?

219
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,580
Ill bet youve never lost, eh?

220
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,080
"Macchi"?

221
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Thats your nickname, isnt it?

222
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,340
Do you remember me telling you about my friend at our wedding who I hadnt seen in years?

223
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,760
Machida Yuuki.

224
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,350
Shed always hated her name back in high school.

225
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,850
She said it sounded too masculine.

226
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,600
What are you saying?

227
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,600
So we nicknamed her "Macchi".

228
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,110
What?

229
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,940
She married a doctor several years ago,

230
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,780
but fretted about being unable to break it off with an old boyfriend.

231
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,120
Youre lying!

232
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
You think Im making this up, too?

233
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,370
Macchi sure does play to win, doesnt she?

234
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,920
I hear her husbands another doctor.

235
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,250
I-It cant be.

236
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,260
Then you mean...

237
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,010
the baby is...

238
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,010
I havent lied to you at all.

239
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,300
Machiko! Wait a minute!

240
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,310
Wait, I...

241
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,940
Enough already!

242
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,940
Ill show you!

243
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,770
Dont!

244
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,070
No...

245
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,570
Congratulations.

246
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,580
Machiko is the winner.

247
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,580
The game is hereby at an end.

248
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,830
Both of you, please proceed this way.

249
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,080
Hold on!

250
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,290
Not yet! Just give me one more try!

251
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,300
Youre too late!

252
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,050
What was that?!

253
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,460
Its too late...

254
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,550
for any of this.

255
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,300
Machiko...

256
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,850
Tell me.

257
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,970
We...

258
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,310
Were dead, arent we?

259
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,060
Yes.

260
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,650
The two of you have already passed on.

261
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,980
Following their deaths,

262
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,320
people are sent to either Heaven or Hell.

263
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,570
Quindecim exists to preside over that judgment.

264
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,450
There is a provision that states that those pairs who die at the same moment may be invited here.

265
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,790
I apologize for being unable to tell you earlier.

266
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,100
Why dont you answer it?

267
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,720
Huh?

268
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,770
I just dont feel like talking.

269
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,900
Give me that! Ill answer it!

270
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,980
Hey, cut it out!

271
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,770
The road! Watch the road!

272
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,450
Were dead?

273
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,960
How could this have happened?

274
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,920
I just...

275
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,130
wanted to start a happy family.

276
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,220
I wanted to be our protector.

277
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,930
How could I have killed my own child?

278
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,470
Thats ludicrous!

279
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,180
Please help us!

280
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,730
Youre God, arent you?!

281
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,480
I am merely an arbiter.

282
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,320
Please! This cant seriously be happening!

283
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,110
Shut up! You can drop the fucking act already!

284
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,860
"Act"?

285
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,610
That is not my child!

286
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,870
Then whose do you think it is?

287
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,620
Another mans, of course!

288
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,710
Takashi...

289
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,420
Youre right.

290
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,420
The thing is...

291
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,670
I love someone else.

292
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,180
I mean, Id have to, right?

293
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,440
Did you honestly think someone was going to fall in love with you?

294
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
What are you, brain-damaged?!

295
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
I was obviously after your money!

296
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,360
You...

297
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,280
So this whole time, its been nothing but lies!

298
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,620
Of course I was lying! Who the hell would want to have your child?!

299
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,830
You dirty bitch!

300
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,500
Fuck!

301
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,840
What is this?!

302
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,590
The game is already over.

303
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,100
I dont give a shit!

304
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,680
Let me go!

305
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,350
I am terribly sorry. The ruling has already been passed down.

306
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,640
Let me hit her!

307
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,520
Let me go, damn it!

308
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,440
Forgive me.

309
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,040
Lets be off.

310
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,090
This way.

311
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,800
Well, then.

312
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I bid you farewell.

313
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,560
Nice job!

314
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Thank you very much.

315
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,070
What did you think?

316
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,570
It was awful.

317
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,530
Youll get used to it soon.

318
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,830
Where did each of them end up going?

319
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,580
Takashis soul was sent for reincarnation,

320
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,330
and Machikos was sent into the void, right?

321
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,290
Yes.

322
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,250
I see.

323
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,090
Um...
